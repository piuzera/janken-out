## Overview

This small project is a proof of concept on the viability of utilizing AI generated art on games.

All the assets presented here were generated with [DALL-E2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) and then slighty tweaked to fit on specific functions.

Inspired by Punch-Out, you'll need to play Rock Paper Scissors and battle your opponent until his HP reaches zero.

## How does it work?
